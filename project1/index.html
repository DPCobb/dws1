				<h3>Where did the name "Hockey" come from?</h3>
				<p id="name"> The name "hockey" has no clear origin. Its first known mention is from the 1773 book Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, 
					to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education, by Richard Johnson 
					(Pseud. Master Michel Angelo), whose chapter XI was titled <em>"New Improvements on the Game of Hockey"</em>. The belief 
					that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by King Edward III of England is based on modern translations of the 
					proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games "Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad 
					Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam". The English historian and biographer John Strype did not use the word "hockey" when he 
					translated the proclamation in 1720. The 1573 Statute of Galway banned a sport called "'hokie' — the hurling of a 
					little ball with sticks or staves". A form of this word was thus being used in the 16th century, though much removed from 
					its current usage. According to the Austin Hockey Association, the word "puck" derives from the Scots Gaelic puc 
					or the Irish poc (to poke, punch or deliver a blow). "...The blow given by a hurler to the ball with his caman or 
					hurley is always called a puck."</p>
				<h3>Early Versions of Ice Hockey</h3>
				<p id="early"> Stick-and-ball games date back to pre-Christian times. In Europe, these games included the Irish game of hurling, the 
					closely related Scottish game of shinty and versions of field hockey (including "bandie ball," played in England). 
					IJscolf, a game resembling colf on an ice-covered surface, was popular in the Low Countries between the Middle Ages 
					and the Dutch Golden Age. It was played with a wooden curved bat (called a colf or kolf), a wooden or leather ball and 
					two poles (or nearby landmarks), with the objective to hit the chosen point using the least number of strokes. A similar 
					game (knattleikr) had been played for a thousand years or more by the Norse, as documented in the Icelandic sagas. In 
					England, evidence of games of 'hockey on ice' (the name replaced "bandie ball"), played with a "bung" (a plug of cork 
					or oak used as a stopper on a barrel) date back to the 1700s.</p> 
				<p> A 1797 engraving unearthed by Swedish sport historians Carl Gidén and Patrick Houda shows a person on skates with a 
					stick and bung on the River Thames, probably in December 1796. British soldiers and immigrants to Canada and the United 
					States brought their stick-and-ball games with them and played them on the ice and snow of winter.</p>
				<p> In 1888, the Governor General of Canada, Lord Stanley of Preston (whose sons and daughter were hockey enthusiasts), 
					first attended the Montreal Winter Carnival tournament and was impressed with the game. In 1892, realizing that there was 
					no recognition for the best team in Canada (although a number of leagues had championship trophies), he purchased a silver 
					bowl for use as a trophy. The Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup (which later became known as the Stanley Cup) was first 
					awarded in 1893 to the Montreal Hockey Club, champions of the <abbr title=" Amateur Hockey Association of Canada">AHAC</abbr>; it continues to be awarded annually to the 
					National Hockey League's championship team. Stanley's son Arthur helped organize the Ontario Hockey Association, and 
					Stanley's daughter Isobel was one of the first women to play ice hockey.</p>
				<h3>Early Professional Hockey</h3>
				<p id="professional"> Professional hockey has existed since the early 20th century. By 1902, the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League was the 
					first to employ professionals. The league joined with teams in Michigan and Ontario to form the first fully professional 
					league—the International Professional Hockey League (<abbr title="International Professional Hockey League">IPHL</abbr>)—in 
					1904. The <abbr title="Western Pennsylvania Hockey League">WPHL</abbr> and <abbr title="International Professional Hockey League">IPHL</abbr> 
					hired players from Canada; in response, Canadian leagues began to pay players (who played with amateurs). 
					The <abbr title="International Professional Hockey League">IPHL</abbr>, cut off from its largest source of players, disbanded in 1907. 
					By then, several professional hockey leagues were operating in Canada (with leagues in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec).</p>
				<p>	In 1910, the National Hockey Association (<abbr title="National Hockey Association">NHA</abbr>) was formed in Montreal. 
					The <abbr title="National Hockey Association">NHA</abbr> would further refine the rules: dropping the rover position, 
					dividing the game into three 20-minute periods and introducing minor and major penalties. After re-organizing as the 
					National Hockey League (<abbr title="National Hockey League">NHL</abbr>) in 1917, the league expanded into the United States, starting with the Boston Bruins in 1924.
				<p> Professional hockey leagues developed later in Europe, since bandy was still popular, but amateur leagues leading to national 
					championships were in place. One of the first was the Swiss National League A, founded in 1916. Today, professional leagues 
					have been introduced in most countries of Europe. Top European leagues include the Kontinental Hockey League, the 
					Czech Extraliga, the Finnish Liiga and the Swedish Hockey League.

				<h3>General Information</h3>
				<p id="general"> Ice hockey is played on a hockey rink. During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, one of them 
					being the goaltender, each of whom is on ice skates. The objective of the game is to score goals by shooting a hard vulcanized 
					rubber disc, the puck, into the opponent's goal net, which is placed at the opposite end of the rink. The players use their sticks 
					to pass or shoot the puck.</p>
				<p> Within certain restrictions, players may redirect the puck with any part of their body. Players may not hold the puck in their 
					hand and are prohibited from using their hands to pass the puck to their teammates, unless they are in the defensive zone. 
					Players are also prohibited from kicking the puck into the opponent's goal, though intentional redirections off the skate are 
					permitted. Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands.</p>
				<p> Hockey is an "off-side" game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s hockey was an on-side 
					game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. Those rules favoured individual stick-handling as a key means of driving 
					the puck forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a truly team sport, where 
					individual performance diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface 
					of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.</p>
				<p> Between the five players on the ice, they are typically divided into three forwards and two defensemen. The forward positions 
					consist of a centre and two wingers: a left wing and a right wing. Forwards often play together as units or lines, with the 
					same three forwards always playing together. The defencemen usually stay together as a pair generally divided between left 
					and right. Left and right side wingers or defencemen are generally positioned as such, based on the side on which they carry 
					their stick. A substitution of an entire unit at once is called a line change. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward 
					lines and defensive pairings when shorthanded or on a power play. Substitutions are permitted at any time during the game, 
					although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it 
					is called changing on the fly. A new NHL rule added in the 2005–2006 season prevents a team from changing their line after 
					they ice the puck.</p>
				<p> The boards surrounding the ice help keep the puck in play and they can also be used as tools to play the puck. Players are 
					permitted to "bodycheck" opponents into the boards as a means of stopping progress. The referees, linesmen and the outsides of 
					the goal are "in play" and do not cause a stoppage of the game when the puck or players are influenced (by either bouncing or 
					colliding) into them. Play can be stopped if the goal is knocked out of position. Play often proceeds for minutes without 
					interruption. When play is stopped, it is restarted with a "faceoff". Two players "face" each other and an official drops 
					the puck to the ice, where the two players attempt to gain control of the puck. Markings on the ice indicate the locations 
					for the faceoff and guide the positioning of players.</p>
				<p> The three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck: "offside", "icing", and the puck going out of 
					play. A player is "offside" if he enters his opponent's zone before the puck itself. Under many situations, a player may not 
					"ice the puck", shoot the puck all the way across both the centre line and the opponent's goal line. The puck goes "out of play" 
					whenever it goes past the perimeter of the ice rink (onto the player benches, over the "glass," or onto the protective netting 
					above the glass) and a stoppage of play is called by the officials using whistles. It also does not matter if the puck comes 
					back onto the ice surface from those areas as the puck is considered dead once it leaves the perimeter of the rink.</p>
				<h3>Periods and Overtime</h3>
				<p id="periods"> Periods are played as follows:</p>
				<ul> 
					<li>Three periods of play</li>
					<li>20 minutes each with short break between periods</li>
					<li>Goaltenders change sides at start of each period</li>
					<li>Clock runs only while puck is in play</li>
				</ul>
				<p> Overtime is played in the National Hockey League with the following rules:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Sudden death, next goal is winning goal</li>
					<li>Period is 5 minutes long</li>
					<li>Consists of three players per side and a goalie</li>
					<li>If no goal is scored a shootout begins</li>
					<li>Team with most goals after six rounds wins</li>
					<li>If score is still tied a sudden death shootout occurs</li>
					<li>In the playoffs 20 minute sudden death overtime periods are played until a goal is scored</li>
				</ul>
