				<h3>Where did the name "Hockey" come from?</h3>
				<p id="name"> The name "hockey" has no clear origin. Its first known mention is from the 1773 book Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, 
					to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education, by Richard Johnson 
					(Pseud. Master Michel Angelo), whose chapter XI was titled <em>"New Improvements on the Game of Hockey"</em>. The belief 
					that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by King Edward III of England is based on modern translations of the 
					proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games "Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad 
					Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam". The English historian and biographer John Strype did not use the word "hockey" when he 
					translated the proclamation in 1720. The 1573 Statute of Galway banned a sport called "'hokie' — the hurling of a 
					little ball with sticks or staves". A form of this word was thus being used in the 16th century, though much removed from 
					its current usage. According to the Austin Hockey Association, the word "puck" derives from the Scots Gaelic puc 
					or the Irish poc (to poke, punch or deliver a blow). "...The blow given by a hurler to the ball with his caman or 
					hurley is always called a puck."</p>
				<h3>Early Versions of Ice Hockey</h3>
				<p id="early"> Stick-and-ball games date back to pre-Christian times. In Europe, these games included the Irish game of hurling, the 
					closely related Scottish game of shinty and versions of field hockey (including "bandie ball," played in England). 
					IJscolf, a game resembling colf on an ice-covered surface, was popular in the Low Countries between the Middle Ages 
					and the Dutch Golden Age. It was played with a wooden curved bat (called a colf or kolf), a wooden or leather ball and 
					two poles (or nearby landmarks), with the objective to hit the chosen point using the least number of strokes. A similar 
					game (knattleikr) had been played for a thousand years or more by the Norse, as documented in the Icelandic sagas. In 
					England, evidence of games of 'hockey on ice' (the name replaced "bandie ball"), played with a "bung" (a plug of cork 
					or oak used as a stopper on a barrel) date back to the 1700s.</p> 
				<p> A 1797 engraving unearthed by Swedish sport historians Carl Gidén and Patrick Houda shows a person on skates with a 
					stick and bung on the River Thames, probably in December 1796. British soldiers and immigrants to Canada and the United 
					States brought their stick-and-ball games with them and played them on the ice and snow of winter.</p>
				<p> In 1888, the Governor General of Canada, Lord Stanley of Preston (whose sons and daughter were hockey enthusiasts), 
					first attended the Montreal Winter Carnival tournament and was impressed with the game. In 1892, realizing that there was 
					no recognition for the best team in Canada (although a number of leagues had championship trophies), he purchased a silver 
					bowl for use as a trophy. The Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup (which later became known as the Stanley Cup) was first 
					awarded in 1893 to the Montreal Hockey Club, champions of the <abbr title=" Amateur Hockey Association of Canada">AHAC</abbr>; it continues to be awarded annually to the 
					National Hockey League's championship team. Stanley's son Arthur helped organize the Ontario Hockey Association, and 
					Stanley's daughter Isobel was one of the first women to play ice hockey.</p>
				<h3>Early Professional Hockey</h3>
				<p id="professional"> Professional hockey has existed since the early 20th century. By 1902, the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League was the 
					first to employ professionals. The league joined with teams in Michigan and Ontario to form the first fully professional 
					league—the International Professional Hockey League (<abbr title="International Professional Hockey League">IPHL</abbr>)—in 
					1904. The <abbr title="Western Pennsylvania Hockey League">WPHL</abbr> and <abbr title="International Professional Hockey League">IPHL</abbr> 
					hired players from Canada; in response, Canadian leagues began to pay players (who played with amateurs). 
					The <abbr title="International Professional Hockey League">IPHL</abbr>, cut off from its largest source of players, disbanded in 1907. 
					By then, several professional hockey leagues were operating in Canada (with leagues in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec).</p>
				<p>	In 1910, the National Hockey Association (<abbr title="National Hockey Association">NHA</abbr>) was formed in Montreal. 
					The <abbr title="National Hockey Association">NHA</abbr> would further refine the rules: dropping the rover position, 
					dividing the game into three 20-minute periods and introducing minor and major penalties. After re-organizing as the 
					National Hockey League (<abbr title="National Hockey League">NHL</abbr>) in 1917, the league expanded into the United States, starting with the Boston Bruins in 1924.
				<p> Professional hockey leagues developed later in Europe, since bandy was still popular, but amateur leagues leading to national 
					championships were in place. One of the first was the Swiss National League A, founded in 1916. Today, professional leagues 
					have been introduced in most countries of Europe. Top European leagues include the Kontinental Hockey League, the 
					Czech Extraliga, the Finnish Liiga and the Swedish Hockey League.
